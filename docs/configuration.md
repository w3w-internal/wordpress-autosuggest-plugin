# Configurating the Plugin

### API Key

You will need a what3words API key to use this plugin, as it authenticates and interacts with the [what3words API](https://developer.what3words.com/public-api). If you don't have a what3words API key yet, you can quickly and easily [sign up and register](https://accounts.what3words.com/create-api-key) for one.

Once you have a what3words API key:

1. Navigate to _Settings > what3words Autosuggest Plugin_
2. Enter your API Key into the API key field.
3. Click _Save_
